> React hooks and content API

Here the documentaion command I'm writing for Mac OS Linux should be similar. If will you use the project windows maybe some command will not similar.

> Notes:
Fist you should install `node` and `npm` node package manager in your system. Then you have to install `create-react-app` CLI. If possible to install or setup environment you may search google but but I have not documented the steps.

### How to use the project any operating sytem?
Fist git clone the project from terminal example:

```git clone https://github.com/mbrsagor/Hooks_ContextAPI```

Then go to project root directory example:
```cd Hooks_ContextAPI/```

Install dependencies npm

```npm install```

Finally runs the app in the development mode.

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
