> This application is simple microservice based architecture web application.

#### Features:
- Product Service:
    - Product CRUD or project related feature
- Order Service:
    - Order related feature

Both service will be connected Rabbitmq message broker and celery.

### Setup:
The following steps will walk you through installation on a Mac. Linux should be similar. It's also possible to develop on a Windows machine, but I have not documented the steps. If you've developed Django apps on Windows, you should have little problem getting up and running.
